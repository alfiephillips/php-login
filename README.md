## Technologies to have a look at:

- [Stripe and Stripe Hooks/Events](https://stripe.com)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [Gutenberg](https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/)
- [Wordpress tools such as Wordpress Block Editor](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/wordpress-block-editor/)
- [Elastisearch](https://www.elastic.co/)
- [Petite Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/petite-vue)

## TODO

- Look into 'sprite' images, one larger image featuring smaller components to avoid re-rendering multiple images; less stress on processing and bandwith. [Look here](https://css-tricks.com/css-sprites/)

- Write up all respective 'README' for documentation purposes.
